/**
 * Kiribati recharge system — backend Web App (v30)
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 * Change from v29: NEW -- a PIN-gated addVoucher action (handleAddVoucher())
 * for the new restock.html admin tool, which lets you photograph a
 * physical voucher card and add it straight to the Vouchers sheet
 * instead of typing rows in by hand. Requires the ADMIN_PIN script
 * property to be set (fails closed with no PIN configured); 5 wrong
 * PIN attempts locks the action out for 15 minutes
 * (isAddVoucherLockedOut()/recordAddVoucherPinFailure(), CacheService,
 * separate from the customer-submission rate limit since this is a
 * much smaller, trusted-user surface). Also fixes a real Sheets bug on
 * this write path: a code starting with "0" was silently losing that
 * leading zero (Sheets auto-detects numeric-looking text) --
 * setNumberFormat("@") before setValue() forces the cell to Plain Text
 * first, so the digits are kept exactly as typed.
 * SETUP: set the ADMIN_PIN script property to whatever PIN you want
 * restock.html to require.
 *
 * Change from v28: doPost()'s "approved" response now also includes
 * voucherCode (the same code just emailed), so the frontend can show
 * it immediately in an on-page popup with a copy/dial button, instead
 * of making the customer wait for email. This is a deliberate change
 * in what the API response exposes -- the code is now visible in the
 * browser (dev tools/network tab), not just delivered via email -- but
 * it's the same recipient who just submitted the payment, so the risk
 * is low. processApprovedRow() now returns { sent, code } instead of a
 * bare boolean; its other caller (onStatusEdit(), manual approval)
 * ignores the return value already, so it needed no change.
 *
 * Change from v27: NEW CHECK -- looksLikeUnsubmittedTransferScreen()
 * catches a "Transfer Confirmation" screen (the review step a banking
 * app shows BEFORE the customer taps Confirm) submitted as if it were
 * proof of payment. That screen already failed ocrContainsSuccessWord()
 * incidentally (its regex needs "confirmed", past tense, which a
 * pre-submit screen doesn't say), but that was never a deliberate
 * guarantee -- a bank whose pre-submit screen happens to also say
 * "Confirmed" would have slipped through. This is now an explicit, hard
 * check: flags either the literal title "Transfer Confirmation", or a
 * "Confirm"/"Cancel" button pair with no "Confirmed" anywhere (the
 * unmistakable signature of a not-yet-submitted screen). Either forces
 * looksValid false -> Rejected, same as any other hard-fail check,
 * recorded in OCR Notes as "Not yet submitted:true/false".
 *
 * Change from v26: bank account number changed back from 906149 to
 * 786149 -- updates ACCOUNT_NUMBER, which the OCR check matches
 * against the screenshot text. Also updated on the frontend (main pay
 * box, "before you pay" popup, and the client-side OCR pre-check's
 * ACCOUNT_NUMBER constant). IMPORTANT: same cutover caveat as the v21
 * account-number change -- any in-flight screenshots taken before this
 * redeploy will show the OLD (906149) number and fail the Acct check
 * under the new rule; expect a short window of Rejected/Pending rows
 * around the cutover, approve those manually if the payment is
 * genuine.
 *
 * Change from v25: the customer voucher email (both
 * sendStandardVoucherEmail() and sendTipEmail()) now also shows the
 * submission's "Reference to Recipient" alongside the Recharge Card
 * Number, so the customer has it on record for support/dispute
 * purposes without needing to dig up their own copy. Sender display
 * name simplified from "AM TOPUP (No-Reply)" to "AM TOPUP".
 *
 * Change from v24: doPost() was only rate-limited per email
 * (RATE_LIMIT_PER_HOUR), trivially bypassed with throwaway addresses --
 * and every submission spends shared account quota regardless of which
 * email was used (MailApp's daily email cap, Drive storage, OCR calls).
 * In particular, alertSuspectedFraud() fires an admin email on every
 * submission with an unrecognized reference, so a bot rotating through
 * fake emails and garbage references could burn through the account's
 * daily MailApp quota on fraud alerts alone -- blocking real customers'
 * voucher emails for the rest of the day. New
 * isPostGloballyRateLimited() adds a site-wide cap (CacheService, no
 * Sheet read, so it's cheap): a tight per-minute bucket
 * (POST_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE, default 5) against a fast bot loop, and a
 * looser per-hour bucket (POST_RATE_LIMIT_PER_HOUR, default 20) against
 * a slow drip spread out to dodge the per-minute one. Checked first in
 * doPost(), before any per-submission work (image decode, OCR, Drive
 * write, email).
 *
 * Change from v23: saveScreenshot() used to make every uploaded payment
 * screenshot ("Anyone with the link" / VIEW) -- meaning anyone who ever
 * obtained that Drive URL (forwarded in an email, pasted in a chat,
 * screen-recorded) could view the customer's banking screenshot
 * indefinitely, no login required. This actually contradicted
 * privacy.html's claim that screenshots are kept in a "private Google
 * Drive folder" with access "limited to those operating the Service" --
 * the file's own sharing setting overrode that regardless of folder
 * permissions. It was also unnecessary: the web app runs "Execute as Me"
 * (the script owner), so the owner already has native Drive access to
 * every file it creates -- no public sharing needed -- and screenshotUrl
 * is only ever used in admin-facing emails/sheet rows, never shown to
 * the customer. setSharing() call removed; new uploads default to
 * private (owner-only, or as explicitly shared later). NOTE: this only
 * affects uploads from now on -- files already created under v23 or
 * earlier keep their existing "Anyone with the link" sharing until
 * manually changed in Drive.
 *
 * Change from v22: doGet() had no rate limiting at all (Apps Script
 * doesn't expose the caller's IP, so per-visitor throttling isn't
 * possible here) -- and since v22 every call appends a row to the
 * Reference sheet, so unthrottled traffic (a bot, a script hammering the
 * endpoint) could grow that sheet without bound and eventually break the
 * site. Two fixes: isGetGloballyRateLimited() caps total doGet() calls
 * per minute, site-wide, using CacheService (script property
 * GET_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE, default 60); and pruneOldReferences() (new
 * trigger, run createReferencePruneTrigger() once) deletes Reference
 * rows older than REFERENCE_MAX_AGE_HOURS (default 6 -- generous past
 * the site's 1-hour submission policy) every hour, so the sheet stays
 * bounded even if the rate cap is ever raised. Neither change affects
 * the frontend: when rate-limited, doGet() returns
 * { availableAmounts: null, reference: null }, which the existing
 * frontend fallback logic already handles (shows all pricing options,
 * uses a locally-generated reference).
 *
 * Change from v21: closes a real fraud gap -- the payment reference
 * code used to be generated entirely client-side (in index.html), so
 * the backend had no way to tell a genuine reference from one a
 * fraudulent customer simply invented. The reference is now generated
 * SERVER-SIDE, in doGet() (issueReference()), and logged to a new
 * "Reference" sheet tab. doPost() checks isReferenceIssuedByUs() --
 * if the submitted reference doesn't match anything this server ever
 * issued, the row is forced to Pending Review (never silently
 * Approved, and never auto-Rejected either, in case the customer's
 * browser just failed to fetch a server-issued reference and fell
 * back to a local one) and an immediate email alert is sent to
 * ADMIN_EMAIL (alertSuspectedFraud()), separate from the daily
 * digests. The frontend still falls back to generating one locally if
 * the GET request fails, so the form never breaks -- it just won't
 * auto-approve in that fallback case.
 * SETUP -- NEW REQUIRED SHEET TAB: "Reference" (2 columns: Reference |
 * Issued At). Until this tab exists, isReferenceIssuedByUs() always
 * returns true (not enforced), so it's safe to redeploy before adding
 * the tab -- the fraud check just won't do anything yet.
 *
 * Change from v20: bank account number changed from 786149 to 906149
 * -- updates ACCOUNT_NUMBER, which the OCR check matches against the
 * screenshot text. Also updated on the frontend (main pay box,
 * "before you pay" popup, and how-to-use instructions). IMPORTANT:
 * any in-flight screenshots taken before this redeploy will show the
 * OLD account number and fail the Acct check under the new rule --
 * expect a short window of Rejected/Pending rows around the cutover;
 * approve those manually if the payment is genuine.
 *
 * Change from v19: NEW -- a free, rule-based daily triage digest for
 * Rejected submissions (sendRejectedTriageDigest()). It buckets each
 * recently-Rejected row by how many individual OCR checks failed --
 * exactly one failed check is a "Close call" worth a human second
 * look (e.g. missed the 1-hour recency window by minutes but
 * everything else matched); two or more failed checks is bucketed as
 * "Likely genuine reject". Purely advisory: never changes Status,
 * never approves, never emails the customer -- just emails ADMIN_EMAIL
 * a summary. No AI/paid API involved, unlike the fuller vision-review
 * agent discussed but not built.
 * SETUP: run createRejectedTriageTrigger() once from the Apps Script
 * editor (select it in the function dropdown, click Run) to schedule
 * it daily at 9am. Optional script property TRIAGE_LOOKBACK_HOURS
 * controls the window (default 24).
 *
 * Change from v18: the v17 bank reference number sequence check no
 * longer requires the submitted number to be strictly higher than the
 * last one accepted -- it now allows it to land up to
 * BANK_REF_SEQ_TOLERANCE (script property, default 400) below the
 * highest one seen so far. This covers other customers' payments
 * arriving out of order in the bank's own numbering, which was
 * wrongly rejecting genuine payments under the strict v17 rule, while
 * still catching an old/reused screenshot whose number is far below
 * the current baseline. See checkBankReferenceNumber().
 *
 * Change from v17: a small underpayment (within UNDERPAY_TOLERANCE, 5
 * cents) no longer blocks auto-approval on its own -- it now goes
 * through the same as an exact-match payment, as long as every other
 * check passes and the amount is within AUTO_APPROVE_MAX. The success
 * response also now includes underTolerance: true/false so the
 * frontend can show a Kiribati-language note under the confirmation
 * message for underpaid-but-approved submissions.
 *
 * Change from v16: NEW CHECK -- the bank's own auto-generated Reference
 * Number on the receipt (e.g. "AQC78922", distinct from the
 * buyer-typed Recipient Reference) is now extracted from the OCR text
 * and its numeric part must be higher than the last one we accepted, or
 * the submission is Rejected (same treatment as the other hard-fail
 * checks). The last-seen number is only advanced on a real
 * auto-approval, never on a rejected/pending row, so a bad submission
 * can't move the baseline. If no such number is found in the OCR text
 * at all, the check isn't enforced (more likely an OCR miss than a real
 * problem) -- see checkBankReferenceNumber()/extractBankRefNumberFromText().
 * IMPORTANT CAVEAT: this assumes ANZ's reference numbers are reliably
 * increasing, which hasn't been independently verified -- worth
 * watching the OCR Notes "BankRefSeq" column after deploying in case it
 * starts wrongly rejecting genuine payments (e.g. if the numbering
 * resets or isn't strictly per-account sequential). If that happens,
 * clear the LAST_BANK_REF_SEQ script property to reset the baseline.
 *
 * Change from v15: submissions that fail verification now split into
 * two outcomes instead of always landing in "Pending Review":
 *   - A real check failure (wrong reference, wrong account, missing
 *     success/bank wording, too old, or a genuine amount mismatch)
 *     -> Status "Rejected", customer sees a kind, professional
 *     rejection message inviting them to contact support if they
 *     think it's a mistake. Row stays in Responses (not archived),
 *     so it can still be manually approved later if needed.
 *   - Fully valid but held back only by the underpay tolerance or
 *     being above AUTO_APPROVE_MAX -> still "Pending Review" as
 *     before, since those are legitimate "needs a human OK" cases,
 *     not failures.
 *
 * Change from v14: both client-facing voucher emails now end with a
 * shared footer -- pill-button links to Terms/Privacy/Refund
 * Policy/Contact (HTML) or plain URLs (plain-text fallback), the
 * support address (neirecharge@gmail.com), and a professional notice
 * that replies to this email are not monitored and get archived
 * unread. The standard voucher email is now HTML+plain-text (was
 * plain-text only). SITE_BASE_URL assumes the site is still hosted
 * at https://dsc26support-beep.github.io/topup/ -- update it there
 * if that ever changes.
 *
 * Change from v13: NEW OPTIONAL SHEET TAB -- "Used Vouchers" (same
 * columns as Vouchers: A code | B amount | C used-marker). Once a
 * claimed voucher's email has actually sent, its row moves out of
 * Vouchers and into "Used Vouchers" -- keeping Vouchers limited to
 * still-available codes. If the email send fails, the claim is
 * reverted in place as before (the row is never moved in that case).
 * Silently does nothing if the tab doesn't exist yet.
 *
 * Change from v12: NEW REQUIRED SHEET TAB -- "Archive" (same columns
 * as Responses: A Timestamp | B Reference | C Name | D Email |
 * E Topup Amount | F Cost Paid | G Method | H Screenshot URL |
 * I Screenshot Hash | J Status | K Voucher Sent | L OCR Notes).
 * Add a header row matching Responses, place it wherever you like
 * (tab order is cosmetic only). Once it exists, any row that's fully
 * successful (Approved + voucher actually emailed) is automatically
 * moved out of Responses and into Archive -- keeping Responses down
 * to just Pending Review / unresolved rows. If the Archive tab
 * doesn't exist yet, archiving is silently skipped (rows just stay
 * in Responses as before -- nothing breaks). Reference and
 * screenshot-hash dedup checks now scan both sheets, so an archived
 * row still blocks a duplicate resubmission.
 *
 * Change from v11: wired in a real TIP_CELEBRATION_GIF_URL (Giphy
 * fireworks GIF) -- not verified live from this environment (no
 * general web access here), worth a manual check after deploying.
 *
 * Change from v10: dropped the "141...#" dial framing from both
 * voucher emails -- just shows the bare code now. The tip email is
 * now a full over-the-top HTML celebration (background GIF, VIP
 * "breaking news" copy) with a plain-text fallback for clients that
 * don't render HTML.
 *
 * Change from v9: amount checking now tolerates a small underpayment
 * (up to 5 cents under still counts as a match, but always forces
 * Pending Review, never auto-approves) and treats overpayment as a
 * tip -- eligible for auto-approve like an exact match, with a
 * celebratory thank-you email showing the tip amount. Also renamed
 * the email sender display name to "AM TOPUP (No-Reply)" and changed
 * the voucher line from a dial instruction to "This is your Recharge
 * Card Number".
 *
 * Change from v8: fixed "Invalid argument" from the v3 Files.create
 * branch -- v3 doesn't accept an "ocr" parameter (only v2 does); it
 * triggers OCR conversion by setting the target mimeType to a Google
 * Doc instead, with just "ocrLanguage" as the optional arg.
 *
 * Change from v7: ocrImage() now works whether the Drive advanced
 * service was added as v2 or v3 -- previously it hardcoded the v2
 * method name (Drive.Files.insert), which throws "is not a function"
 * if v3 (Drive.Files.create) was added instead.
 *
 * Change from v6: the EXIF ("looks like a photo, not a screenshot")
 * check no longer blocks submission -- it was rejecting legitimate
 * screenshots that picked up EXIF data after being forwarded/re-saved
 * through another app. It's now recorded as "Exif:true/false" in the
 * OCR Notes column for visibility only, and no longer affects
 * auto-approval eligibility.
 *
 * Change from v5: the phone number field was removed from the form
 * (the voucher code isn't tied to any specific number — the buyer
 * dials it on whichever phone they're topping up). Rate limiting and
 * screenshot filenames now key off email instead of phone.
 *
 * SETUP — Script Properties (unchanged from v5, plus v23's two below):
 *   AUTO_APPROVE_MAX, SCREENSHOT_FOLDER_ID, BANK_KEYWORDS,
 *   RATE_LIMIT_PER_HOUR, MIN_IMAGE_BYTES, MAX_TRANSACTION_AGE_HOURS,
 *   ADMIN_EMAIL
 *   New in v23 (both optional, sensible defaults if unset):
 *   GET_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE (default 60), REFERENCE_MAX_AGE_HOURS
 *   (default 6)
 *   New in v25 (both optional, sensible defaults if unset):
 *   POST_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE (default 5), POST_RATE_LIMIT_PER_HOUR
 *   (default 20)
 *   Recommended BANK_KEYWORDS value based on your screenshot: "ANZ"
 *
 * IMPORTANT — Responses sheet columns changed (Phone column removed):
 * A Timestamp | B Reference | C Name | D Email | E Topup Amount
 * F Cost Paid | G Method | H Screenshot URL | I Screenshot Hash
 * J Status | K Voucher Sent | L OCR Notes
 * If you already have a live sheet from v5, either delete the old
 * Phone column (D) and shift the rest left, or start a fresh sheet.
 *
 * Other setup, same as before:
 *   - Services > + > Drive API (advanced service, enables OCR -- either
 *     v2 or v3 works, ocrImage() below detects which one is enabled)
 *   - Run createApprovalTrigger() once for the manual-approval fallback
 *   - Run createDailyDigestTrigger() once for the pending-review digest
 *   - Run createReferencePruneTrigger() once (v23) to keep the
 *     Reference sheet from growing unbounded
 *   - Deploy > New deployment > Web app, Execute as Me, Access: Anyone

// action is refused entirely (fails closed, not open).
//
// Brute-force protection: 5 wrong PINs locks the action out for 15
// minutes (CacheService counter, script-wide -- coarse but cheap, no
// Sheet read needed). This is separate from isPostGloballyRateLimited()
// (the customer-submission rate limit) since this is a much smaller,
// trusted-user surface with a different threat model (PIN guessing, not

//     payment to have been wrongly rejected (e.g. missed the 1-hour
//     recency window by a few minutes). Worth a human double-check.
//   - two or more checks failed -> "Likely genuine reject" -- multiple
//     independent signals disagreed, consistent with a real mismatch,
//     reused screenshot, or fraud attempt.
// This is purely advisory: it never changes Status, never approves
// anything, never emails the customer -- it only emails ADMIN_EMAIL a
